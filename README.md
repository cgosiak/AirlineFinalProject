# AirlineFinalProject
This is the repository for the final project in Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It also contains useful information about the methods, and parameters of classes; as well as their descriptions.

# Main
This is the <i>MAIN</i> hub of our program. It is responsible for abstracting all of our classes into readily accessible and available methods of getters and setters. This section will outline the methods: how to use them, and what they result in.
