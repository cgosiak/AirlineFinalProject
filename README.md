# AirlineFinalProject
This is the repository for the final project in Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It also contains useful information about the methods, and parameters of classes; as well as their descriptions.

# Main
This is the <i>MAIN</i> hub of our program. It is responsible for abstracting all of our classes into readily accessible and available methods of getters and setters. This section will outline the methods: how to use them, and what they result in.

#Time/Task Log

(11/4/2015 - 10:12 AM)(Matt L.)
	Updated UML Diagram. Added basic frames for the following classes: DbManager, Airport parent class with Hub and Spoke child classes, Route, Plane, Seat parent class with Economy, EconPlus, and FirstClass child classes, Passenger

(11/12/2015 - 1:30 PM)(Caleb G.)
	Updated Master, added in my program 3 class structure/working program. Feel this is a good place to start with our project as it has many of classes implemented that we have chosen to include in our final program.

(11/23/2015 - 12:00 PM)(Caleb G.)
	Merged changes into Master: Updated header files, namespaces, and added a flight class.

(11/24/2015 - 10:30 AM)(Caleb G.)
	Figured out how to dynamically create new flight objects and keep track of them!! Whoop whoop!

(11/24/2015 - 5:00  PM)(Caleb G.)
	Created start of passenger class.

(11/24/2015 - 9:00  PM)(Caleb G.)
	Did a lot of work on Flight Class, started implementing very simple tests for method implementation. Pointers are working!!!

(11/25/2015 - 12:30  PM)(Caleb G.)
	Implemented Successful Methods To:
	-Add New Flight to Schedule
	-Add New Passenger to Flight
	-Print Upcoming Flights
	-Print a List of Passengers on a Flight
	Will polish methods later! Also, I must note the being able to print the list of passengers to a flight also is the method I will use to print all passengers at the airport! Thus there is no need to keep track of an full list of all passengers at the airport, we would just make that list dynamically.

(11/25/2015 - 2:14  PM)(Caleb G.)
	Added running program, with user selection tool menus! Some options still need to be added!

(11/28/2015 through 11/30/2015 - 12:45  PM)(Caleb G.)
	Added ability to read from external files!!! Works correctly!
